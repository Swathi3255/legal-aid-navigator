Q01,"No, a 12% rent increase exceeds California’s statewide rent cap. Under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482), landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. This applies to most rental units over 15 years old, including those in Los Angeles.","Rent increases are limited under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482). Most tenants in California are protected by a statewide rent cap: landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year."
Q02,"No. The statewide rent cap under AB 1482 only applies to buildings that are 15 years or older. Since your apartment is only 10 years old, it is not covered by the rent cap, unless your city has a local ordinance that includes newer buildings (San Diego’s local rent control, if any, would need to be checked separately).","This law applies to buildings over 15 years old, excluding single-family homes unless owned by corporations."
Q03,"You have several options. First, you must have given written notice. If the landlord still hasn’t acted after a reasonable time (typically 30 days for non-urgent issues, less for health hazards like mold), you may legally withhold rent (placed in a separate account), “repair and deduct” (up to one month’s rent), or potentially terminate the lease. Retaliation for requesting repairs is illegal.","If something breaks or becomes unsafe, you must notify your landlord in writing. They generally have 30 days to make repairs... If you exercise your legal rights—such as requesting repairs... your landlord cannot raise your rent, reduce services, or threaten eviction in response."
Q04,"No. Under California’s “just cause” eviction law (AB 1482), landlords cannot evict tenants simply because a lease expired. They must have a valid reason, such as nonpayment, violation of lease terms, or owner move-in (with relocation assistance in rent-controlled cities like Oakland).",Evictions require 'just cause' under AB 1482. This means your landlord cannot evict you simply because your lease ended or they want to raise the rent.
Q05,"Within 21 days after you move out, your landlord must return your full security deposit or provide an itemized written statement explaining any deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125.","Within 21 days after you move out, your landlord must return your full deposit or provide an itemized written statement explaining any deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125."
Q06,"No. Self-help evictions—including shutting off utilities—are illegal in Texas, even for late rent. Landlords must go through the formal court eviction process. You can report this to local authorities or seek legal aid.","Self-help evictions (changing locks, shutting off utilities) are illegal."
Q07,"In Texas, landlords must typically provide 30 days’ notice for a rent increase in a month-to-month tenancy. Since you’ve lived there 8 months, you’re likely on a month-to-month lease (unless your original lease auto-renewed).","Landlords may increase rent by any amount, provided they give proper notice—typically 30 days for month-to-month tenancies."
Q08,"In extreme heat, AC is considered essential. After giving written notice, you may be able to “repair and deduct” (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease if the landlord fails to act within a reasonable time—which for life-threatening conditions like no AC in summer could be as short as 3–7 days.","If your landlord fails to make necessary repairs, you may have the right to repair and deduct (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease—but only after giving written notice and allowing a reasonable time (usually 7 days for urgent issues, 30 for non-urgent)."
Q09,"Yes. Texas law does not cap security deposits. However, the landlord must return it within 30 days if you provided a forwarding address and there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear.","Security deposits are not capped by state law, but landlords must return them within 30 days after you move out if you provided a forwarding address."
Q10,"If you don’t pay or vacate within 3 days, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (forcible entry and detainer). You’ll receive a court summons. Do not ignore it—you have the right to appear in court and present your case. If you lose, a constable may forcibly remove you.","If you miss rent, your landlord must give you a 3-day 'Notice to Vacate.' If you don’t pay or move out, they can file an eviction lawsuit... You have the right to appear in court and present your side. Never ignore court papers."
Q11,No. Refusing to rent based on familial status (having children under 18) violates the federal Fair Housing Act and is illegal in all 50 states.,"It is illegal to discriminate based on... familial status (having children under 18)... A landlord cannot refuse to rent to someone because they are... pregnant, or have children."
Q12,"No. Under the Fair Housing Act, landlords must allow reasonable modifications at the tenant’s expense for disabilities. They cannot unreasonably deny such requests.",Landlords must allow reasonable modifications to the unit (like installing grab bars) at the tenant’s expense.
Q13,"No. This implies a preference against families with children, which violates the Fair Housing Act’s prohibition on discrimination based on familial status.","Advertisements cannot state preferences like 'ideal for single professionals' or 'no kids,' as these imply discrimination."
Q14,"You have the right to a reasonable accommodation for an emotional support animal (ESA) under the Fair Housing Act, even in “no pets” buildings. The landlord cannot charge a pet fee, but you must provide documentation from a healthcare professional.",Landlords must... make reasonable accommodations in rules or policies—such as allowing a service animal in a 'no pets' building.
Q15,"For HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS) violations, landlords generally have 30 days to complete repairs. For life-threatening issues (e.g., gas leaks, no heat in winter), they must act within 24 hours.","They must fix HQS violations within 30 days, or 24 hours for life-threatening issues like gas leaks."
Q16,"You must report changes in income, household size, or address to your PHA within 10 days. Failure to do so can result in overpayment bills or loss of assistance.","You must report changes in income, household size, or address to your PHA within 10 days."
Q17,No. You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA can evict you for nonpayment or other lease violations. Due process is required in all HUD programs.,"You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA makes major decisions affecting your tenancy, including eviction."
Q18,California offers significantly stronger rent control. It has a statewide rent cap (max 10% increase/year) and “just cause” eviction protections. Texas has no rent control and allows rent increases with only 30 days’ notice.,(From CA doc) Rent increases are limited... max 10% per year. + (From TX doc) Texas does not have rent control. Landlords may increase rent by any amount...
Q19,"All three layers apply, but federal HUD rules govern subsidy terms (rent calculation, inspections), while California and local laws still protect your rights as a tenant (e.g., habitability, security deposits). The most protective rule usually prevails.","(HUD doc) You have the right to a safe, decent, and sanitary home that meets HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. + (CA doc) Your right to a habitable home is guaranteed under Civil Code Section 1941."
Q20,"Yes. In Texas, you’d need to give written notice and allow a “reasonable time” (likely 7 days for urgent heat issues) before using remedies like repair-and-deduct. In California, the landlord must fix habitability issues within 30 days (sooner for emergencies), and retaliation is strictly prohibited. California also offers stronger enforcement through local housing authorities.","(TX) Urgent issues like no heat in winter require faster action... usually 7 days for urgent issues. + (CA) Landlords must maintain the rental unit in a condition fit for human occupation... They generally have 30 days to make repairs, though urgent issues... require faster action."

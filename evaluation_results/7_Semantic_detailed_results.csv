Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"Under California law, rent increases are limited to 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. Since your landlord in Los Angeles raised your rent by 12%, this increase exceeds the legal cap and is not considered lawful under California law.",2.2908923625946045,87.10000000000001,True
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"Since your apartment in San Diego is 10 years old, the statewide rent cap under California law does not apply to you. The rent cap applies to buildings that are over 15 years old. Therefore, your rent increases are not limited by the statewide rent cap, but local ordinances or your lease terms may still have specific provisions.",1.5414912700653076,96.2,True
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"In California, if your landlord has not fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks, you have several legal options:

1. **Request Repairs in Writing:** Send a written notice to your landlord detailing the mold issue and requesting prompt repairs. Keep a copy for your records.

2. **Use Repair and Deduct or Withhold Rent:** If the landlord ignores your request, you may have the option to repair the mold issue yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, or withhold rent (by placing it in a separate bank account). Be cautious and follow legal procedures carefully to avoid eviction.

3. **Report the Habitability Issue:** California law guarantees your right to a habitable home. Mold that affects health and safety can be considered a breach of the landlord’s obligation to maintain the property in a livable condition. You can report the issue to local health or building authorities.

4. **Legal Action:** If the landlord refuses to address the mold problem, you may consider filing a complaint with your local housing agency or seeking legal assistance. You can also pursue a rent reduction or damages through the courts.

5. **Protection Against Retaliation:** California law prohibits landlords from retaliating against tenants who exercise their rights, such as reporting health hazards like mold.

6. **Consult Legal Resources:** For free or low-cost assistance, visit LawHelpCA.org or contact your local legal aid organization.

It’s important to document all communications and take photos of the mold to support your case. If the mold poses a serious health risk, consider consulting a healthcare professional and local health department for further guidance.",4.297447443008423,361.40000000000003,True
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"Based on the information provided, your landlord in Oakland cannot evict you simply because your one-year lease ended. Under California law and local rent control ordinances, evictions require a valid reason, known as “just cause,” such as nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, creating a nuisance, or the owner moving in (with proper notice and possibly relocation assistance in rent-controlled cities like Oakland). No-cause evictions are generally illegal for most tenants. Therefore, your landlord cannot evict you solely because your lease ended without a valid reason and following proper legal procedures.",2.0761516094207764,135.20000000000002,True
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord is required to return your security deposit within 21 days after you move out.

Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"In Texas, it is illegal for a landlord to shut off your utilities, including electricity, as a form of self-help eviction or retaliation. The Texas Tenant Handbook states that self-help evictions, such as changing locks or shutting off utilities, are illegal. Therefore, your landlord shutting off your electricity because you were five days late on rent is not allowed under Texas law. If this has happened, you may want to seek legal assistance to protect your rights.",1.5294766426086426,126.10000000000001,True
Q07,I’ve lived in my Dallas apartment for 8 months. How much notice does my landlord need to give me for a rent increase?,"In Texas, if you have been living in your apartment for 8 months, your landlord is generally required to give you 30 days' notice before increasing the rent on a month-to-month tenancy.",1.210005283355713,70.2,True
Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days. What can I do under Texas law?","Under Texas law, since your AC has been broken for 10 days and your landlord has not fixed it, you have certain rights. Texas law requires landlords to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, which includes providing functioning cooling systems during extreme weather. 

You can take the following steps:
1. **Provide Written Notice:** Send a written repair request to your landlord, detailing the issue and requesting prompt repair.
2. **Allow a Reasonable Time:** After giving notice, you should allow a reasonable time for the landlord to make repairs (usually 7 days for urgent issues like a broken AC in extreme heat).
3. **Repair and Deduct or Withhold Rent:** If the landlord does not respond or fix the issue within a reasonable time, you may have the option to repair the AC yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, or withhold rent (by placing it in a separate account). Be cautious and follow legal procedures carefully to avoid eviction.
4. **Terminate the Lease:** If the issue significantly affects your health or safety, you may have the right to terminate the lease.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, you can seek assistance from legal aid organizations such as Texas RioGrande Legal Aid or Lone Star Legal Aid, or contact the Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division for further guidance.

Never attempt self-help measures like changing locks or shutting off utilities, as these are illegal.",4.468079566955566,344.5,True
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","In Texas, there is no state law that caps or limits the amount a landlord can charge for a security deposit. Therefore, a landlord can legally charge a security deposit of $3,000 for a $1,200/month apartment. However, the landlord must return the deposit within 30 days after you move out, and deductions can only be made for actual damages beyond normal wear and tear.",2.9030370712280273,102.7,True
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you do not leave after receiving a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (known as forcible entry and detainer) against you. This legal process involves the court, and if the court rules in favor of the landlord, they can obtain a judgment for possession of the property. Once the judgment is issued, the landlord can request a law enforcement officer to remove you from the premises. 

It is important to respond to court notices and seek legal assistance if you wish to contest the eviction or need help understanding your rights. Ignoring the eviction process can result in an automatic eviction and loss of your right to stay in the property. Never attempt to remove yourself or change locks without following legal procedures, as self-help evictions are illegal.",2.6854987144470215,205.4,True
Q11,My landlord refused to rent to me because I have two young children. Is that legal anywhere in the U.S.?,"No, it is generally illegal in the United States for a landlord to refuse to rent to someone because they have children. The Fair Housing Act, a federal law enforced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), prohibits discrimination based on familial status, which includes having children under 18. This means landlords cannot refuse to rent to families with children or impose different terms or conditions because of children. If your landlord refused to rent to you solely because of your children, that could be considered illegal discrimination under federal law.",2.0326035022735596,146.9,True
Q12,I use a wheelchair and need to install grab bars in my bathroom. Can my landlord say no?,"Your landlord cannot say no to installing grab bars in your bathroom if you need them for accessibility. Under fair housing laws, landlords are required to make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities, which includes allowing modifications like grab bars. You should request this in writing and, in some cases, may need to agree to restore the property to its original condition when you move out, unless otherwise specified. If your landlord refuses, you may have legal protections to enforce your right to make necessary modifications for your disability.",1.623176097869873,137.8,True
Q13,Is it legal for a rental ad to say 'perfect for young professionals'?,"Based on the provided context, it is not legal for a rental advertisement to specify ""perfect for young professionals"" or similar preferences that imply a preference or limitation based on age, gender, or other protected classes. The Fair Housing Act prohibits such statements because they can be considered discriminatory and suggest a preference that could exclude certain groups, which is illegal under federal law.",2.35176944732666,98.8,True
Q14,"My landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed,  but I have a doctor’s note. What are my rights?","If you have a doctor’s note confirming that your animal is an emotional support animal (ESA), your landlord generally cannot refuse to allow it. Under federal law, ESAs are considered a reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities, and landlords are required to make exceptions to no-pet policies in such cases.

However, landlords may request documentation to verify that the animal is indeed an ESA and that you have a disability. They cannot, however, require detailed medical information or ask for the animal’s training or behavior records.

If your landlord refuses to allow your emotional support animal despite your doctor’s note, you can assert your rights under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability. You may want to provide the documentation from your healthcare provider and remind your landlord of their legal obligation to accommodate your disability-related needs.

If you encounter resistance or eviction threats, consider seeking assistance from a legal aid organization or tenant rights group familiar with fair housing laws.",2.8252620697021484,235.3,True
Q15,I’m on Section 8 in Chicago. My landlord says the unit failed inspection—how long do they have to fix it?,"In Chicago, if your unit fails a Section 8 inspection, the landlord is generally required to fix the issues within 30 days. For life-threatening or urgent health and safety violations, repairs must be completed within 24 hours. It’s important to communicate your concerns to your landlord in writing and keep records of all inspections and repair requests. If the landlord does not make the necessary repairs within these timeframes, you may have options such as reporting the issue to your Public Housing Authority (PHA) or seeking further assistance.",2.1399073600769043,139.1,True
Q16,I got a pay raise. How soon do I need to report it to my Public Housing Authority?,"According to the information provided, you are required to report any changes in your income, household size, or address to your Public Housing Authority (PHA) within 10 days. Since a pay raise affects your income, you should report this change to your PHA as soon as possible, ideally within 10 days of receiving the raise.",1.6590828895568848,93.60000000000001,True
Q17,Can my PHA evict me without a hearing if I’m late on my portion of the rent?,"Based on the provided information, your Public Housing Authority (PHA) cannot evict you without a hearing if you are late on your portion of the rent. The rights outlined indicate that eviction is a legal process that requires a valid reason (""just cause"") and adherence to court procedures. You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA makes major decisions affecting your tenancy, including eviction. Therefore, your PHA cannot evict you without providing a hearing.",1.6303117275238037,122.2,True
Q18,Which state offers stronger rent control: California or Texas?,"Based on the provided information, California offers stronger rent control protections than Texas. California has statewide rent caps limiting rent increases to 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum of 10% per year, and local ordinances in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland may provide even stronger protections. Additionally, California has strict regulations on security deposits, eviction procedures, and tenant rights.

In contrast, Texas generally does not have rent control laws. Landlords can increase rent by any amount with proper notice, and there are fewer restrictions on rent increases and tenant protections.

Therefore, California offers stronger rent control than Texas.",1.871575117111206,148.20000000000002,True
Q19,"If I live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California,  which rules apply—federal","If you live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California, your rights and responsibilities are primarily governed by federal regulations through HUD programs. These include protections related to maintaining a safe and decent living environment, inspection standards, rent calculations based on income, and protections against retaliation or unfair eviction practices. 

However, it's important to note that California law also provides additional protections for tenants, such as rent control ordinances in certain cities, rules about security deposits, and specific procedures for eviction and repairs. 

In summary, both federal HUD regulations and California state and local laws apply to your HUD-subsidized apartment. You are protected by federal standards under HUD, but you also benefit from California's tenant rights laws and local ordinances where applicable.",2.4155044555664062,171.6,True
Q20,"My landlord in San Antonio won’t fix a broken heater in January. Would the rules be different if I lived in San Francisco?  State,  or local?","The rules regarding repairs and tenant protections can vary significantly between Texas and California, especially in cities like San Francisco that have local rent control ordinances. 

In Texas (San Antonio), landlords are required to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, including fixing essential systems like heating during winter. If a landlord refuses to repair a broken heater, tenants generally need to give written notice and wait a reasonable time (usually 7 days for urgent issues). Tenants may have options like repair and deduct or withholding rent, but these must be used carefully.

In California, particularly in cities with rent control like San Francisco, tenants have stronger protections. Landlords are also required to maintain habitable conditions, including fixing essential services like heating. If a landlord refuses to make necessary repairs, tenants can send a written repair request, and if ignored, they may have additional remedies such as withholding rent or repair and deduct, but these actions are more regulated and protected under local laws. San Francisco's rent control laws also restrict eviction reasons and provide additional tenant protections.

So, yes, the rules can be different if you lived in San Francisco. California's local ordinances generally provide stronger tenant protections and specific procedures for repairs and disputes compared to Texas.",3.779773235321045,313.3,True

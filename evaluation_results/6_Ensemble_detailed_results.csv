Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"Based on California law, as outlined in the provided context, rent increases are generally limited to no more than 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. Since your landlord in Los Angeles raised your rent by 12%, this exceeds the statewide cap of 10%. Therefore, a 12% increase is not legal under California law unless there are specific local rent control ordinances that allow for higher increases. However, Los Angeles has its own rent control laws that may provide additional protections, so it would be advisable to check if local ordinances permit such a raise. 

In summary, under the statewide rent cap, a 12% increase is generally not permitted. You may want to consult a local tenant rights organization or legal professional for specific guidance related to Los Angeles.",2.296731948852539,202.8,True
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"Based on the information provided, the statewide rent cap in California applies to buildings that are over 15 years old. Since your apartment is 10 years old, the statewide rent cap does not apply to you. However, if your building is part of a local rent control ordinance in San Diego, that could provide additional protections. It's best to check with local housing authorities or your landlord for specific rules that may apply to your apartment.",2.035639524459839,119.60000000000001,True
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"In California, if your landlord has not fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks, you have several legal options to consider:

1. **Notify Your Landlord in Writing:** Ensure you have documented your request for repairs in writing. This creates a record and formally notifies your landlord of the issue.

2. **Request Urgent Repairs if Necessary:** Since mold can pose health risks, it may be considered an urgent issue. California law generally requires landlords to address urgent repairs promptly, often within 24-72 hours.

3. **Withhold Rent or Repair and Deduct:** If the landlord fails to repair the mold after a reasonable period, you may have the option to withhold rent (by placing it in a separate bank account) or to repair the problem yourself and deduct the cost from your rent. However, these remedies must be used carefully to avoid eviction risks.

4. **Report the Issue to Local Authorities:** You can contact local health or building departments to report the mold problem. They can inspect the property and may require the landlord to make repairs.

5. **Seek Legal Assistance:** If the landlord refuses to fix the mold, you may consider consulting a tenant rights organization or legal aid for guidance. You might also have grounds for a rent reduction or to pursue a claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, which requires landlords to maintain rental units in a habitable condition.

6. **File a Complaint or Take Legal Action:** If necessary, you can file a complaint with local housing authorities or pursue legal action for breach of habitability. Courts can order the landlord to fix the problem and may award damages.

Remember, taking these steps carefully and documenting all communications and actions is important. For personalized legal advice, consult a qualified attorney or a local tenant rights organization.",5.187051296234131,409.5,True
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"In Oakland, your landlord cannot evict you just because your one-year lease ended. Under AB 1482, evictions require a ""just cause,"" meaning the landlord must have a valid reason such as nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, creating a nuisance, or the owner moving in (with proper notice and possibly relocation assistance). No-cause evictions are generally illegal for most tenants. Therefore, simply ending your lease does not give your landlord the right to evict you without a valid reason.",2.10532283782959,119.60000000000001,True
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord is required to return your full security deposit within 21 days after you move out.

Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"In Texas, landlords are not allowed to shut off your utilities, including electricity, as a way to enforce rent payment or for any other reason. Doing so is considered an illegal self-help eviction tactic. The Texas Tenant Handbook states that ""self-help evictions (changing locks, shutting off utilities) are illegal."" Therefore, your landlord shutting off your electricity because you were five days late on rent is not permitted under Texas law. If this has happened, you may want to seek legal assistance to understand your rights and explore your options.",2.051379680633545,141.70000000000002,True

Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days.

Texas landlords are required to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, including functioning cooling systems during extreme weather. 

You should first provide written notice to your landlord requesting the repair. If the landlord fails to make the necessary repairs within a reasonable time—generally 7 days for urgent issues—you may have the right to take further action. These actions can include:

- Repair and deduct: You can arrange for the repair yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, but this should be done carefully to avoid eviction risks.
- Terminate the lease: If the issue significantly affects your health or safety, you may have grounds to terminate the lease.

Additionally, if the landlord's failure to repair makes the unit uninhabitable, you may be able to seek legal remedies or contact local housing authorities for assistance. For specific guidance and to ensure your rights are protected, consider consulting a legal aid organization such as Texas RioGrande Legal Aid or Lone Star Legal Aid.",3.348088264465332,274.3,True
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","In Texas, there is no state law that caps the amount a landlord can charge for a security deposit. Therefore, a landlord can charge a $3,000 security deposit for a $1,200/month apartment. However, the landlord must return the deposit within 30 days after you move out, provided you give a forwarding address, and deductions can only be made for actual damages beyond normal wear and tear.",1.947295904159546,105.3,True
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you do not leave after receiving a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (forcible entry and detainer) against you. This legal process involves the landlord going to court to seek an order to remove you from the property. You have the right to appear in court and present your side. Ignoring the eviction process can lead to an official court order for your removal, and the sheriff or local law enforcement may then carry out the eviction. It is important to respond to eviction notices and seek legal assistance if needed.",1.9553613662719727,157.3,True
Q11,My landlord refused to rent to me because I have two young children. Is that legal anywhere in the U.S.?,"In the United States, under the federal Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent to someone because they have children under 18, which includes young children. Discrimination based on familial status is prohibited nationwide. Therefore, refusing to rent to you because you have two young children is not legal anywhere in the U.S.",1.437373161315918,101.4,True
Q12,I use a wheelchair and need to install grab bars in my bathroom. Can my landlord say no?,"Under the Fair Housing Act, your landlord cannot say no to installing grab bars or refuse reasonable modifications needed for your disability.

Q13,Is it legal for a rental ad to say 'perfect for young professionals'?,"Based on the information provided, it is not legal for a rental advertisement to specify preferences like ""perfect for young professionals"" because such language can imply a discriminatory preference based on age or occupation, which may violate fair housing laws. The Fair Housing Act prohibits advertisements that indicate preferences or limitations based on protected classes, including familial status, sex, or age, if they suggest discrimination.

Therefore, saying ""perfect for young professionals"" in a rental ad could be considered discriminatory and is not advisable.",2.0569944381713867,123.5,True
Q14,"My landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed,  but I have a doctor’s note. What are my rights?","Your rights regarding emotional support animals (ESAs) depend on federal and state laws. Under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), landlords are generally required to make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities, which includes allowing ESAs even if the building has a ""no pets"" policy. Since you have a doctor’s note confirming your need for an emotional support animal, your landlord must provide a reasonable accommodation and cannot refuse to allow your ESA solely based on their pet policy.

However, landlords can request documentation to verify that the animal is necessary for your disability and that it is a reasonable accommodation. They cannot charge pet fees or deposits for ESAs, but they can require that the animal is well-behaved and does not pose a direct threat to others.

If your landlord refuses to allow your emotional support animal despite your doctor’s note, they may be violating fair housing laws. You can assert your rights by providing the necessary documentation and requesting a reasonable accommodation. If they continue to refuse, you may consider filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or seeking legal assistance.

Always keep written records of your communications and your doctor’s note, and consider consulting a legal professional or tenant rights organization for personalized guidance.",4.358836889266968,297.7,True

Therefore, eviction cannot occur without proper procedures, including a hearing, even if you are late on rent.",2.187138319015503,123.5,True
Q18,Which state offers stronger rent control: California or Texas?,"Based on the provided information, California offers stronger rent control protections than Texas. California has a statewide rent cap limiting rent increases to no more than 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year.

Q19,"If I live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California,  which rules apply—federal","If you live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California, federal rules apply. Specifically, HUD programs are governed by federal regulations that ensure tenants have the right to a safe, decent, and sanitary home that meets HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. These standards include requirements for inspections, repairs, and reporting issues.

Q20,"My landlord in San Antonio won’t fix a broken heater in January. Would the rules be different if I lived in San Francisco?  State,  or local?","Yes, the rules regarding a landlord’s obligation to fix a broken heater can differ based on location, including state and local laws. 

In **San Antonio, Texas**, landlords are generally required to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, which includes fixing essential services like heating during extreme weather. If a landlord refuses to repair a heater, tenants may have rights to repair and deduct or terminate the lease after providing proper notice.

In **San Francisco, California**, there are stronger tenant protections. California law guarantees that landlords must maintain rental units in a habitable condition, which includes providing functioning heating during winter. The California Civil Code states that repairs for urgent issues like no heat in winter should be addressed promptly, often within a shorter timeframe (such as 30 days or less for urgent repairs). Additionally, local ordinances in San Francisco may impose even stricter requirements and enforcement mechanisms.

**In summary:**
- **Texas (San Antonio):** Landlords must comply with health and safety codes, including fixing heating issues, but specific procedures and timelines may vary.
- **California (San Francisco):** State law and local ordinances provide strong protections requiring landlords to repair heating promptly, especially during winter.

So, yes, the rules are different, with California generally offering more robust tenant protections and quicker response requirements for repairs like heating.",5.190507888793945,322.40000000000003,True

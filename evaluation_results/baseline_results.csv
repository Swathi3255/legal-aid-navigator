Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"No, that is not legal under California law. Rent increases are capped statewide at 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. Since Los Angeles may also have local rent control ordinances that offer even stronger protections, a 12% increase exceeds both the statewide cap and likely local limits.","No, a 12% rent increase exceeds California’s statewide rent cap. Under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482), landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. This applies to most rental units over 15 years old, including those in Los Angeles.",[],"Rent increases are limited under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482). Most tenants in California are protected by a statewide rent cap: landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year."
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"No, the statewide rent cap does not apply to your 10-year-old apartment. According to the context, the rent cap law in California applies to buildings over 15 years old, excluding single-family homes unless owned by corporations. Your building is only 10 years old, so it is not covered by the statewide rent cap.","No. The statewide rent cap under AB 1482 only applies to buildings that are 15 years or older. Since your apartment is only 10 years old, it is not covered by the rent cap, unless your city has a local ordinance that includes newer buildings (San Diego’s local rent control, if any, would need to be checked separately).",[],"This law applies to buildings over 15 years old, excluding single-family homes unless owned by corporations."
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"Based on the provided context, your legal options in California if your landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks are:

1. You must notify your landlord in writing about the mold problem.
2. Generally, landlords have 30 days to make repairs, but since this issue has lasted 6 weeks, the landlord has already exceeded that timeframe.
3. If the landlord refuses to make major repairs, such as addressing mold, you can:
   - Send a written repair request (which you should have done).
   - If ignored, you may be able to withhold rent by placing it in a separate bank account.
   - Alternatively, you may be able to use the “repair and deduct” remedy by fixing the problem yourself and subtracting the cost from your rent, up to one month’s rent.
4. Use these remedies carefully, as missteps can lead to eviction.
5. Additionally, retaliation by the landlord (such as raising rent, cutting services, or threatening eviction within 180 days of you asserting your rights) is illegal and presumed to be retaliatory.

For further assistance, you may contact local legal aid organizations or tenant support groups.

In summary, you should have notified your landlord in writing, and since 6 weeks have passed without repair, you may be able to withhold rent or repair and deduct, while protecting yourself from retaliation.","You have several options. First, you must have given written notice. If the landlord still hasn’t acted after a reasonable time (typically 30 days for non-urgent issues, less for health hazards like mold), you may legally withhold rent (placed in a separate account), “repair and deduct” (up to one month’s rent), or potentially terminate the lease. Retaliation for requesting repairs is illegal.",[],"If something breaks or becomes unsafe, you must notify your landlord in writing. They generally have 30 days to make repairs... If you exercise your legal rights—such as requesting repairs... your landlord cannot raise your rent, reduce services, or threaten eviction in response."
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"No, your landlord in Oakland cannot evict you just because your one-year lease ended. Under AB 1482, evictions require “just cause,” and no-cause evictions are illegal for most tenants. Valid reasons for eviction include nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, nuisance, or the owner moving in with proper notice and relocation assistance in some cases.","No. Under California’s “just cause” eviction law (AB 1482), landlords cannot evict tenants simply because a lease expired. They must have a valid reason, such as nonpayment, violation of lease terms, or owner move-in (with relocation assistance in rent-controlled cities like Oakland).",[],Evictions require 'just cause' under AB 1482. This means your landlord cannot evict you simply because your lease ended or they want to raise the rent.
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord must return your full security deposit or provide an itemized written statement explaining any deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125, within 21 days after you move out.","Within 21 days after you move out, your landlord must return your full security deposit or provide an itemized written statement explaining any deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125.",[],"Within 21 days after you move out, your landlord must return your full deposit or provide an itemized written statement explaining any deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125."
Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"No, that is not allowed in Texas. According to the context, self-help evictions—such as shutting off utilities—are illegal.","No. Self-help evictions—including shutting off utilities—are illegal in Texas, even for late rent. Landlords must go through the formal court eviction process. You can report this to local authorities or seek legal aid.",[],"Self-help evictions (changing locks, shutting off utilities) are illegal."
Q07,I’ve lived in my Dallas apartment for 8 months. How much notice does my landlord need to give me for a rent increase?,"According to the Texas Tenant Handbook context, landlords in Texas must give proper notice for rent increases—typically 30 days for month-to-month tenancies.","In Texas, landlords must typically provide 30 days’ notice for a rent increase in a month-to-month tenancy. Since you’ve lived there 8 months, you’re likely on a month-to-month lease (unless your original lease auto-renewed).",[],"Landlords may increase rent by any amount, provided they give proper notice—typically 30 days for month-to-month tenancies."
Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days. What can I do under Texas law?","Under Texas law, if your landlord fails to make necessary repairs like a broken air conditioning system, you must first give written notice and allow a reasonable time for repair—usually 7 days for urgent issues. Since your landlord has not fixed it in 10 days after your notice, you may have the right to repair and deduct the cost (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease, but only after providing written notice and allowing that reasonable repair period.","In extreme heat, AC is considered essential. After giving written notice, you may be able to “repair and deduct” (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease if the landlord fails to act within a reasonable time—which for life-threatening conditions like no AC in summer could be as short as 3–7 days.",[],"If your landlord fails to make necessary repairs, you may have the right to repair and deduct (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease—but only after giving written notice and allowing a reasonable time (usually 7 days for urgent issues, 30 for non-urgent)."
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","Based on the provided context, Texas does not have a state law capping security deposits. Therefore, a landlord in Texas can charge any amount for a security deposit, including $3,000 for a $1,200/month apartment, as there is no state limit mentioned.","Yes. Texas law does not cap security deposits. However, the landlord must return it within 30 days if you provided a forwarding address and there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear.",[],"Security deposits are not capped by state law, but landlords must return them within 30 days after you move out if you provided a forwarding address."
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you receive a 3-day “Notice to Vacate” in Texas and do not pay or move out, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (forcible entry and detainer). You have the right to appear in court and present your side. It is important not to ignore court papers, as doing so results in automatic eviction.","If you don’t pay or vacate within 3 days, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (forcible entry and detainer). You’ll receive a court summons. Do not ignore it—you have the right to appear in court and present your case. If you lose, a constable may forcibly remove you.",[],"If you miss rent, your landlord must give you a 3-day 'Notice to Vacate.' If you don’t pay or move out, they can file an eviction lawsuit... You have the right to appear in court and present your side. Never ignore court papers."
Q11,My landlord refused to rent to me because I have two young children. Is that legal anywhere in the U.S.?,"Based on the provided context, it is not legal anywhere in the U.S. for a landlord to refuse to rent to someone because they have children under 18. The Fair Housing Act protects familial status, including having children under 18, and prohibits discrimination in all aspects of housing, including rental decisions. For example, landlords cannot charge higher deposits or refuse housing to families with children. Therefore, refusing to rent because you have two young children would be discriminatory and illegal.",No. Refusing to rent based on familial status (having children under 18) violates the federal Fair Housing Act and is illegal in all 50 states.,[],"It is illegal to discriminate based on... familial status (having children under 18)... A landlord cannot refuse to rent to someone because they are... pregnant, or have children."
Q12,I use a wheelchair and need to install grab bars in my bathroom. Can my landlord say no?,"No, your landlord cannot say no. People with disabilities have additional rights, and landlords must allow reasonable modifications to the unit, such as installing grab bars, even if the tenant pays for them.","No. Under the Fair Housing Act, landlords must allow reasonable modifications at the tenant’s expense for disabilities. They cannot unreasonably deny such requests.",[],Landlords must allow reasonable modifications to the unit (like installing grab bars) at the tenant’s expense.
Q13,Is it legal for a rental ad to say 'perfect for young professionals'?,"No, it is not legal. Rental advertisements cannot state preferences like “ideal for single professionals” or “no kids,” as these imply discrimination.","No. This implies a preference against families with children, which violates the Fair Housing Act’s prohibition on discrimination based on familial status.",[],"Advertisements cannot state preferences like 'ideal for single professionals' or 'no kids,' as these imply discrimination."
Q14,"My landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed,  but I have a doctor’s note. What are my rights?","Based on the provided context from the Fair Housing Act Summary, landlords must make reasonable accommodations in rules or policies for people with disabilities. This includes allowing service animals in buildings that have a “no pets” policy. Emotional support animals are typically covered under these reasonable accommodations if you have proper documentation, such as a doctor's note.

Therefore, even if your landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed, if you have a doctor’s note, your landlord is generally required to allow your emotional support animal as a reasonable accommodation.","You have the right to a reasonable accommodation for an emotional support animal (ESA) under the Fair Housing Act, even in “no pets” buildings. The landlord cannot charge a pet fee, but you must provide documentation from a healthcare professional.",[],Landlords must... make reasonable accommodations in rules or policies—such as allowing a service animal in a 'no pets' building.
Q15,I’m on Section 8 in Chicago. My landlord says the unit failed inspection—how long do they have to fix it?,"If your unit fails a Housing Quality Standards (HQS) inspection under Section 8, your landlord or Public Housing Authority (PHA) must fix HQS violations within 30 days. For life-threatening issues like gas leaks, they must make repairs within 24 hours.","For HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS) violations, landlords generally have 30 days to complete repairs.

How soon do I need to report it to my Public Housing Authority?,You must report changes in income to your Public Housing Authority (PHA) within 10 days.,"You must report changes in income, household size, or address to your PHA within 10 days. Failure to do so can result in overpayment bills or loss of assistance.",[],"You must report changes in income, household size, or address to your PHA within 10 days."
Q17,Can my PHA evict me without a hearing if I’m late on my portion of the rent?,"Based on the provided context, you have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA makes major decisions affecting your tenancy, including eviction. Therefore, your PHA cannot evict you without a hearing if you are late on your portion of the rent.",No. You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA can evict you for nonpayment or other lease violations. Due process is required in all HUD programs.,[],"You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA makes major decisions affecting your tenancy, including eviction."
Q18,Which state offers stronger rent control: California or Texas?,"California offers stronger rent control. According to the context, California has a statewide rent cap limiting rent increases to no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. Local rent control ordinances in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland may offer even stronger protections. In contrast, Texas does not have rent control, and landlords may increase rent by any amount as long as they give proper notice.",California offers significantly stronger rent control. It has a statewide rent cap (max 10% increase/year) and “just cause” eviction protections. Texas has no rent control and allows rent increases with only 30 days’ notice.,[],(From CA doc) Rent increases are limited... max 10% per year. + (From TX doc) Texas does not have rent control. Landlords may increase rent by any amount...
Q19,"If I live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California,  which rules apply—federal","If you live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California, both federal rules and California state laws apply. 

Federal rules include your rights under HUD programs, such as the right to a safe, decent, and sanitary home that meets HUD’s Housing Quality Standards (HQS), requirements for inspections and recertifications, and protections under the Fair Housing Act against discrimination. You are also responsible for paying rent on time, keeping your unit clean, and notifying your Public Housing Agency (PHA) of changes.

At the same time, California state laws provide additional tenant protections such as rent control limits (5% plus CPI with a maximum 10% increase per year on certain properties), the right to a habitable home under Civil Code Section 1941 (landlord must maintain essential services and repair serious issues promptly), and regulations on security deposits.

Therefore, tenants in HUD-subsidized apartments in California are covered by both federal HUD regulations and California state tenant protection laws, as well as any applicable local ordinances.","All three layers apply, but federal HUD rules govern subsidy terms (rent calculation, inspections), while California and local laws still protect your rights as a tenant (e.g., habitability, security deposits). The most protective rule usually prevails.",[],"(HUD doc) You have the right to a safe, decent, and sanitary home that meets HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. + (CA doc) Your right to a habitable home is guaranteed under Civil Code Section 1941."
Q20,"My landlord in San Antonio won’t fix a broken heater in January. Would the rules be different if I lived in San Francisco?  State,  or local?","Yes, the rules would be different. According to the context, Texas landlords (including those in San Antonio) must maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with local health and safety codes, including operable heating systems during extreme weather. If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs, tenants may have options like repair and deduct or lease termination after notice.

In contrast, San Francisco is in California, which has statewide tenant protections including rent control and strong habitability laws. California law requires landlords to maintain essential services like heat, and local rent control ordinances in cities like San Francisco may offer even stronger protections. Therefore, the regulations and tenant remedies in San Francisco (California) would generally provide stronger tenant protections regarding repairs than those in San Antonio (Texas).","Yes. In Texas, you’d need to give written notice and allow a “reasonable time” (likely 7 days for urgent heat issues) before using remedies like repair-and-deduct. In California, the landlord must fix habitability issues within 30 days (sooner for emergencies), and retaliation is strictly prohibited. California also offers stronger enforcement through local housing authorities.",[],"(TX) Urgent issues like no heat in winter require faster action... usually 7 days for urgent issues. + (CA) Landlords must maintain the rental unit in a condition fit for human occupation... They generally have 30 days to make repairs, though urgent issues... require faster action."

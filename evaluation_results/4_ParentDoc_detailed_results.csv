Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"Based on the information provided, under California law, rent increases are generally limited by the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482). This law caps annual rent increases at 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. 

Since your rent was increased by 12%, this exceeds the maximum allowable increase under the statewide law. However, it's important to note that local rent control ordinances in cities like Los Angeles may offer even stronger protections. 

You should check if Los Angeles has specific rent control laws that apply to your rental unit, as these could restrict rent increases further. 

In summary, a 12% increase is likely not legal under California's statewide rent cap, but local ordinances may have different rules. It would be advisable to consult a local tenants' rights organization or a legal professional for specific guidance related to your situation.",3.3358423709869385,217.1,True
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"Based on the information provided, the statewide rent cap in California applies to most rental units over 15 years old. Since you live in a 10-year-old apartment, the rent cap does not automatically apply to your unit under the statewide law. However, local rent control ordinances in cities like San Diego may offer additional protections, so it's worth checking if San Diego has its own rent control laws that could affect your rent increases.",1.5499212741851807,117.0,True
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"In California, if your landlord has not fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks, you have several legal options. You can request that the landlord make necessary repairs, and if they fail to do so, you may have the right to take further action. California law requires landlords to maintain rental properties in a habitable condition, which includes addressing mold issues that can affect health.

You can consider the following steps:
1. **Notify your landlord in writing** about the mold problem and request repairs.
2. **Report the issue to local health or building authorities**, who can inspect and require the landlord to fix the problem.
3. **Withhold rent or make repairs and deduct the cost** (known as ""repair and deduct"") if the landlord refuses to act, but only after proper notice and following legal procedures.
4. **File a complaint or seek legal advice** from a legal aid organization or tenant rights group.

Be aware that retaliating against tenants for asserting their rights (like reporting health hazards) is illegal. If your landlord retaliates, you may have additional legal protections.

It’s advisable to consult with a local tenant rights organization or legal aid for specific guidance tailored to your situation.",3.8408501148223877,278.2,True
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"In Oakland, your landlord cannot evict you simply because your one-year lease ended. Under California law, evictions require a valid reason, known as “just cause,” such as nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, nuisance, or owner move-in with proper notice and relocation assistance in some cases. No-cause evictions are generally illegal for most tenants. Therefore, your landlord cannot evict you solely because your lease has expired.",1.5644984245300293,102.7,True
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord is required to return your security deposit within 21 days after you move out. If there are any deductions, the landlord must provide you with an itemized written statement explaining those deductions, along with receipts for repairs over $125.",2.362962484359741,76.7,True
Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"In Texas, landlords are generally not allowed to shut off utilities, including electricity, as a way to enforce rent payments. Doing so can be considered illegal, especially if it violates tenant rights or local laws. Since your landlord shut off your electricity after you were five days late on rent, this action may not be permitted under Texas law. It is advisable to contact a legal aid organization or the Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division for assistance and to understand your rights better.",1.7329978942871094,135.20000000000002,True
Q07,I’ve lived in my Dallas apartment for 8 months. How much notice does my landlord need to give me for a rent increase?,"In Texas, for a month-to-month tenancy, your landlord is generally required to give you at least 30 days' notice before increasing the rent. Since you have lived in your Dallas apartment for 8 months, this rule still applies. Therefore, your landlord should provide you with a written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the rent increase.",1.4954063892364502,107.9,True
Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days. What can I do under Texas law?","Under Texas law, since your AC has been broken for 10 days and the issue affects the habitability of your rental unit, you have certain rights. Texas law requires landlords to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, which includes functioning heating and cooling systems during extreme weather.

You should have given your landlord written notice of the problem and allowed a reasonable time for repairs—typically 30 days for non-urgent issues. Since it has been 10 days, and if the heat or cooling is essential due to extreme weather conditions, you may consider informing your landlord again in writing about the urgent need for repair.

If the landlord does not respond or fix the issue within a reasonable time, you may have options such as:
- Repair and deduct: paying for the repair yourself and deducting the cost from your rent (up to one month’s rent), after providing written notice.
- Terminate the lease: if the issue significantly affects your health or safety, you might be able to terminate the lease.

It’s advisable to document all communications and keep records of the issue. If the landlord continues to neglect repairs, you may want to seek further assistance from local housing authorities or consult a legal professional familiar with Texas tenant rights.",3.2729837894439697,312.0,True
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","In Texas, there are no specific state laws limiting the amount a landlord can charge for a security deposit. Landlords can generally require a security deposit that they deem appropriate, provided it is not used as a penalty or for illegal purposes. 

However, it is common practice and often recommended that security deposits be reasonable and proportional to the rent amount. For a $1,200/month apartment, a $3,000 security deposit is higher than typical, but not necessarily illegal under Texas law. 

It’s important to check the lease agreement and any local ordinances, as some cities may have their own rules. Also, Texas law requires landlords to return the security deposit within 30 days after the tenant moves out, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear.

**In summary:** Yes, a landlord in Texas can charge a $3,000 security deposit for a $1,200/month apartment, but it may be considered unusually high. It’s advisable to review the lease and local regulations, and ensure the deposit is not used as a penalty or for illegal reasons.",6.465012788772583,245.70000000000002,True
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you do not leave after receiving a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth, the landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (called forcible entry and detainer) against you. You will have the opportunity to appear in court and present your side. If you ignore the court papers or do not respond, an automatic eviction may occur. It is important to address the situation promptly and seek legal assistance if needed. Never attempt to remove yourself or change locks without going through the proper legal process, as self-help evictions are illegal.",1.8642969131469727,141.70000000000002,True
Q11,My landlord refused to rent to me because I have two young children. Is that legal anywhere in the U.S.?,"Under the Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent to someone because they have children under 18, which is referred to as familial status protection. Therefore, refusing to rent to you because you have two young children is not legal anywhere in the U.S. If this has happened to you, you may consider filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within one year of the incident.",1.5923137664794922,126.10000000000001,True
Q12,I use a wheelchair and need to install grab bars in my bathroom. Can my landlord say no?,"Under the Fair Housing Act, landlords are required to make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities. Installing grab bars in your bathroom to improve accessibility is considered a reasonable modification. Your landlord cannot say no to this request if it is necessary for your use and safety. You should inform your landlord of your need for the grab bars, and they are generally obligated to allow the modification at your expense. If they refuse, it may be considered discrimination under federal law.",1.8027925491333008,128.70000000000002,True
Q13,Is it legal for a rental ad to say 'perfect for young professionals'?,"Based on the Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for rental advertisements to specify preferences or limitations based on protected classes such as race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), familial status, or disability. Phrases like ""perfect for young professionals"" could be considered discriminatory if they imply a preference based on age, gender, or other protected characteristics.

Therefore, stating ""perfect for young professionals"" in a rental ad may be problematic because it could be interpreted as a preference that discriminates against other groups, which is not allowed under the Fair Housing Act. It is advisable to avoid such language to ensure compliance with fair housing laws.

If you have further questions or need specific legal advice, consulting a legal professional or fair housing expert is recommended.",3.157097578048706,185.9,True
Q14,"My landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed,  but I have a doctor’s note. What are my rights?","Under the Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for your landlord to refuse to allow your emotional support animal if you have a valid doctor’s note or documentation from a healthcare professional. Landlords are required to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, which includes allowing emotional support animals even in buildings that have a “no pets” policy. 

Your rights include requesting your landlord to make such reasonable accommodations. If they refuse, they may be violating federal law. You can provide your doctor’s note as proof of your need for the emotional support animal. If your landlord continues to deny your request, you have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or seek legal assistance to enforce your rights.

Please remember to keep records of your communication and your doctor’s documentation. If you need further assistance, consider consulting a legal aid organization or a fair housing advocate.",2.688318967819214,224.9,True
Q15,I’m on Section 8 in Chicago.

Q17,Can my PHA evict me without a hearing if I’m late on my portion of the rent?,"Based on the provided information, your PHA cannot evict you without a hearing if you are late on your portion of the rent. You have the right to a formal grievance hearing before your PHA makes major decisions affecting your tenancy, including eviction.",1.1420836448669434,76.7,True
Q18,Which state offers stronger rent control: California or Texas?,"Based on the provided information, California offers stronger rent control protections than Texas. California has a statewide rent cap limiting rent increases to 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year, and additional local rent control ordinances in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland may provide even stronger protections. In contrast, Texas does not have rent control laws, and landlords can increase rent by any amount with proper notice.",2.160623550415039,114.4,True
Q19,"If I live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California,  which rules apply—federal","If you live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California, both federal and local rules may apply. The federal regulations, provided by HUD, establish your rights and responsibilities regarding safe housing, rent calculations, inspections, privacy, and grievance procedures. However, it is also important to check local ordinances in California, as they can impose additional rules or protections. Therefore, your housing situation is governed by federal HUD rules along with any applicable local laws.",1.7096612453460693,107.9,True
Q20,"My landlord in San Antonio won’t fix a broken heater in January. Would the rules be different if I lived in San Francisco?  State,  or local?","In Texas (including San Antonio), the law generally requires landlords to maintain rental units in a habitable condition, including fixing issues like a broken heater, especially during extreme weather. If the landlord fails to do so, tenants may have rights to repair and deduct or terminate the lease after proper notice.

In California (including San Francisco), tenant protections are generally stronger. California law guarantees the right to a habitable home, requiring landlords to repair essential services like heat promptly, especially in winter. Additionally, California has specific laws and local ordinances that limit rent increases and require ""just cause"" for eviction, providing tenants with more comprehensive protections.

So, yes, the rules would be different if you lived in San Francisco. California law offers stronger tenant protections and specific procedures for repairs and habitability issues compared to Texas.",2.7527129650115967,209.3,True

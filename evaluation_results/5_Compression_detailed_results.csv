Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"Based on California law, there is a statewide rent cap that limits how much a landlord can increase rent each year. Specifically, landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year. Since your rent increase was 12%, it exceeds the legal limit of 10% for the year. Therefore, a 12% rent increase is not legal under California law.",2.423430919647217,118.3,True
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"Based on the information provided, the statewide rent cap in California applies to buildings that are over 15 years old. Since your apartment is 10 years old, the statewide rent cap does not apply to you.",1.442115068435669,67.60000000000001,True
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"In California, if your landlord hasn't fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks, you have several legal options:

1. **Notify Your Landlord in Writing:** Send a written repair request detailing the mold issue. Keep a copy for your records.

2. **Request a Walk-Through Inspection:** You can request an inspection to document the problem before moving out or taking further action.

3. **Withhold Rent or Repair and Deduct:** If the landlord fails to address the issue, you may be able to withhold rent (by placing it in a separate bank account) or repair the problem yourself and deduct the cost from your rent—up to one month’s rent. Be cautious and follow legal procedures to avoid eviction risks.

4. **Report the Issue:** Since mold can affect health, you can contact local health or housing authorities to report the problem. They can inspect and require the landlord to make repairs.

5. **Legal Action:** If the landlord refuses to fix the mold and the issue affects your health or safety, you may consider consulting a legal aid organization or an attorney to explore further remedies, such as filing a complaint or seeking damages.

Remember, California law guarantees tenants the right to a habitable home, and landlords are required to maintain the property in a condition fit for human occupation, including addressing mold issues promptly. If you're unsure about the proper steps or need assistance, contacting a local tenant rights organization or legal aid can provide guidance tailored to your situation.",6.35944938659668,340.6,True
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"In Oakland, your landlord cannot evict you simply because your one-year lease has ended. Under California law, evictions require a ""just cause,"" meaning the landlord must have a valid reason such as nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, nuisance, or the owner moving in (with proper notice and possibly relocation assistance). No-cause evictions are generally illegal for most tenants. Therefore, ending a lease alone does not give your landlord the right to evict you without a valid reason.",2.2768797874450684,118.3,True
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord is required to return your security deposit within 21 days after you move out.",1.3179607391357422,44.2,True
Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"In Texas, landlords are not allowed to shut off utilities, including electricity, as a way to force a tenant to leave or because of late rent. Doing so is considered a form of illegal self-help eviction. The Texas Tenant Handbook states that self-help evictions, such as changing locks or shutting off utilities, are illegal. If your landlord shut off your electricity because you were five days late on rent, this action is not permitted under Texas law. You may want to contact a legal aid organization or the Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division for assistance.",2.6937661170959473,150.8,True
Q07,I’ve lived in my Dallas apartment for 8 months. How much notice does my landlord need to give me for a rent increase?,"In Texas, if you have a month-to-month tenancy, your landlord is required to give you at least 30 days' notice before increasing the rent. Since you have lived in your Dallas apartment for 8 months, this notice period still applies.",1.7311375141143799,80.60000000000001,True
Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days. What can I do under Texas law?","Under Texas law, if your landlord fails to repair essential systems like the air conditioning during extreme weather, you have certain rights. You should first provide written notice to your landlord requesting the repair and allow a reasonable time for them to fix the issue—usually 7 days for urgent problems like a broken AC. If the landlord does not respond or fix the problem within that time, you may have the right to repair the issue yourself and deduct the cost from your rent (""repair and deduct"") or consider terminating the lease. However, these actions should be taken carefully, following proper legal procedures, to avoid eviction risks. If you need further assistance, you can contact legal aid organizations such as Texas RioGrande Legal Aid or Lone Star Legal Aid.",3.0685689449310303,196.3,True
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","In Texas, there is no legal limit on the amount a landlord can charge for a security deposit. The Texas Tenant Handbook states that security deposits are not capped by state law. Therefore, a landlord can charge a $3,000 security deposit for a $1,200/month apartment if they choose to do so.",3.6150426864624023,85.8,True
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you do not leave after receiving a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth, Texas, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (also called forcible entry and detainer). This legal process involves the court, and if the court rules in favor of the landlord, they can obtain a judgment for eviction. Once the judgment is issued, law enforcement can carry out the eviction, which may involve physically removing you from the property. It is important to respond to eviction notices and seek legal help if needed, as ignoring the process can lead to forced removal and additional legal consequences.",2.3615052700042725,153.4,True

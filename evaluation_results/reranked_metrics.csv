My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,[],I don't know,"No, a 12% rent increase exceeds California’s statewide rent cap. Under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482), landlords may increase rent by no more than 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a maximum total increase of 10% per year.

Q01,My landlord in Los Angeles raised my rent by 12% this year. Is that legal under California law?,"Under California law, rent increases are generally limited to a maximum of 5% plus the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a hard cap of 10% total per year. Since your landlord in Los Angeles raised your rent by 12%, this increase exceeds the statewide legal limit. Therefore, a 12% rent increase is not legal under California law unless there are specific local ordinances or exceptions that allow for higher increases, which is unlikely in Los Angeles given the statewide cap. It may be advisable to consult with a local tenants' rights organization or legal professional to explore your options.",1.9514415264129639,152.1,True
Q02,I live in a 10-year-old apartment in San Diego. Does the statewide rent cap apply to me?,"Based on the information provided, the statewide rent cap in California applies to buildings that are over 15 years old. Since your apartment is 10 years old, the statewide rent cap does not apply to you. However, local rent control ordinances in cities like San Diego may have their own rules, so it's a good idea to check with local housing authorities for any additional protections.",1.9032256603240967,106.60000000000001,True
Q03,My landlord hasn’t fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks. What are my legal options in California?,"In California, if your landlord hasn't fixed a mold problem for 6 weeks, you have several legal options:

1. **Notify Your Landlord in Writing:** Send a written request demanding that they address the mold issue. Keep a copy for your records.

2. **Request Repairs Promptly:** Under California law, landlords are generally required to maintain the rental unit in a habitable condition, which includes addressing mold that can affect health.

3. **Report the Issue to Authorities:** If your landlord fails to act, you can contact local health or building departments to file a complaint. They can inspect the property and require the landlord to make necessary repairs.

4. **Withhold Rent or Repair and Deduct:** You may have the option to withhold rent or pay for repairs yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, but these remedies must be used carefully and in accordance with legal procedures to avoid eviction.

5. **Legal Action:** You can consider filing a complaint in small claims court for failure to maintain a habitable living environment or seek legal advice from a tenant rights organization or legal aid.

6. **Protection Against Retaliation:** California law prohibits your landlord from retaliating against you for asserting your rights, such as reporting health hazards.

It’s advisable to consult with a tenant rights organization or a legal professional to ensure you follow proper procedures and protect your rights. For free or low-cost assistance, you can visit LawHelpCA.org or contact your local legal aid office.",3.596360683441162,336.7,True
Q04,Can my landlord in Oakland evict me just because my one-year lease ended?,"In Oakland, your landlord cannot evict you simply because your one-year lease has ended. Under California law, and specifically under AB 1482, evictions require a ""just cause."" This means your landlord must have a valid reason for eviction, such as nonpayment of rent, violation of lease terms, nuisance, or the owner moving in (with proper notice and possibly relocation assistance). No-cause evictions are generally illegal for most tenants. Therefore, ending a lease does not automatically give your landlord the right to evict you without a valid reason.",2.2600772380828857,128.70000000000002,True
Q05,How long does my landlord have to return my security deposit after I move out in California?,"In California, your landlord is required to return your security deposit within 21 days after you move out.",1.6259377002716064,44.2,True
Q06,My landlord in Houston shut off my electricity because I was 5 days late on rent. Is that allowed in Texas?,"In Texas, landlords are not allowed to shut off utilities, including electricity, as a way to force a tenant to leave or for any other reason. Doing so is considered an illegal self-help eviction. Since your landlord in Houston shut off your electricity because you were five days late on rent, this action is not permitted under Texas law. You may want to contact a legal aid organization or the Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division for assistance.",1.7798666954040527,127.4,True
Q07,I’ve lived in my Dallas apartment for 8 months.

Q08,"My AC broke in July in Austin,  and my landlord hasn’t fixed it in 10 days. What can I do under Texas law?","Under Texas law, your landlord is required to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, including functioning cooling systems during extreme weather. Since your AC has been broken for 10 days, you may have the right to request repairs. If the landlord fails to fix the issue after a reasonable amount of time (usually 7 days for urgent issues like a broken AC in extreme heat), you could consider taking further action.

Possible steps include:
- Providing written notice to your landlord requesting repair.
- If the landlord does not respond or fix the issue within a reasonable time, you may have the right to repair and deduct (up to one month’s rent) or terminate the lease.

If you need assistance or if the landlord refuses to address the problem, you can contact legal aid organizations such as Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, Lone Star Legal Aid, or the Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division for guidance and support.",3.761965036392212,243.1,True
Q09,"Can a landlord in Texas charge a $3, 000 security deposit for a $1, 200/month apartment?","In Texas, there is no state law that limits the amount a landlord can charge for a security deposit. Therefore, a landlord can charge a $3,000 security deposit for a $1,200/month apartment. However, the landlord must return the deposit within 30 days after you move out, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear.",2.019956350326538,92.3,True
Q10,I received a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent. What happens if I don’t leave?,"If you do not leave after receiving a 3-day notice to vacate in Fort Worth for late rent, your landlord can file an eviction lawsuit (forcible entry and detainer) against you. This legal process involves the court, and if the court rules in favor of the landlord, they can obtain a judgment for eviction. Once the judgment is issued, law enforcement can enforce the eviction, and you may be required to leave the property. Ignoring the notice or the court process can lead to legal eviction and potential additional legal consequences.",1.9429388046264648,141.70000000000002,True
Q11,My landlord refused to rent to me because I have two young children. Is that legal anywhere in the U.S.?,"In the United States, under the Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent to someone because they have children under 18. Discrimination based on familial status, which includes having young children, is prohibited. Therefore, refusing to rent to you solely because you have two young children is not legal. If you believe you have been discriminated against, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).",2.0188443660736084,126.10000000000001,True
Q12,I use a wheelchair and need to install grab bars in my bathroom. Can my landlord say no?,"Based on the information provided, your landlord cannot say no to installing grab bars in your bathroom if you need them due to a disability. Under the Fair Housing Act, people with disabilities have additional rights, and landlords are required to allow reasonable modifications to the unit at the tenant’s expense. This includes installing grab bars to accommodate your needs.",1.2763853073120117,100.10000000000001,True
Q13,Is it legal for a rental ad to say 'perfect for young professionals'?,"Based on the Fair Housing Act and related laws, it is generally not permissible for a rental advertisement to specify preferences or limitations based on protected classes such as age, race, gender, familial status, or disability. Saying ""perfect for young professionals"" could be interpreted as a preference for a certain age group, which may be considered discriminatory and could violate fair housing laws. 

However, laws can vary by jurisdiction, and some areas may have specific regulations about advertising language. It is advisable to avoid language that could be seen as discriminatory and to focus on the features of the property itself.

In summary, while I cannot provide legal advice, generally, stating ""perfect for young professionals"" in a rental ad might be problematic under fair housing laws because it could imply a preference based on age or lifestyle, which is protected under federal law.

If you need specific legal guidance, consulting a legal professional or local housing authority is recommended.",3.64890193939209,222.3,True
Q14,"My landlord says emotional support animals aren’t allowed,  but I have a doctor’s note. What are my rights?","Your rights are protected under the Fair Housing Act, which requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. Since you have a doctor’s note confirming your need for an emotional support animal, your landlord must allow it, even if the building has a “no pets” policy. 

If your landlord refuses to permit your emotional support animal, they may be violating fair housing laws. You can provide them with your doctor’s note as documentation of your need. If they continue to deny your request, you have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within one year of the incident. 

Additionally, retaliation against you for asserting your rights—such as raising your rent, threatening eviction, or cutting services—is illegal. If you experience discrimination or retaliation, you can seek legal assistance or contact fair housing organizations for support.",2.14318585395813,210.6,True

Q19,"If I live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California,  which rules apply—federal","If you live in a HUD-subsidized apartment in California, federal rules apply to your housing situation. These federal regulations establish your rights to a safe, decent, and sanitary home that meets HUD’s Housing Quality Standards, as well as rules regarding rent calculations and reporting requirements.

Q20,"My landlord in San Antonio won’t fix a broken heater in January. Would the rules be different if I lived in San Francisco?  State,  or local?","The rules regarding a landlord’s obligation to fix a broken heater can vary depending on the state and local laws. 

In Texas (specifically in San Antonio), landlords are required to maintain the rental unit in a condition that complies with health and safety codes, including operable heating systems during extreme weather. If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after proper notice, tenants may have rights such as repair and deduct or lease termination.

In California (including San Francisco), tenants also have strong protections. The law guarantees a habitable home, requiring landlords to maintain essential services like heat, especially during winter. If a landlord refuses to make urgent repairs, tenants have the right to request faster action, and the law emphasizes the importance of maintaining a habitable environment.

While the core principle—landlords must provide and maintain essential services—is similar, the specific procedures, timelines, and protections can differ between Texas and California. Local ordinances in San Francisco may impose even stricter rules or additional tenant protections compared to state law.

So, yes, the rules can be different depending on whether you live in San Antonio, Texas, or San Francisco, California, both at the state and local levels.",3.531047821044922,287.3,True
